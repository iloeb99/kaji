- Function overloading
	Idea: Have the StringMap `built_in_decls` map from string keys to a list of
	function objects of instead of single functions
	Think these functions should have different names because I'm not sure that
	the IRgen can deal with multiple functions with the same name easily (the
	pattern matching gets weird), instead semant.ml should translate the
	overloaded function into a differently named function that IRgen can call
	and refer to more easily.

- Check equality of strings? Either through some kind of strcmp()/equals() or
  directly through the == operator

- Disallow declaration of list<void> by user?

- guard against doing the binops with non-int types
